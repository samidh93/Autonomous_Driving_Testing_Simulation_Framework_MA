Categories of Behavioral Competencies | Specific Behavioral Competencies
----------------- | ------------------------------
Tactical Maneuvers |
Parking <br/>(Note: ODD may include parking garages, surface lots, parallel parking)|<br>- Navigate a parking lot, locate spaces, make appropriate forward and reverse parking maneuvers
Lane Maintenance & Car Following <br/>(Note: ODD may include high and low speed roads) | - Car following, including stop and go, lead vehicle changing lanes, and responding to emergency braking<br/>- Speed maintenance, including detecting changes in speed limits and speed advisories<br/>- Lane centering<br/>- Detect and respond to encroaching vehicles<br/>- Enhancing conspicuity (e.g., headlights)<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicles turning at non-signalized junctions
Lane Change<br/>(Note: ODD may include high and low speed roads) | <br/>- Lane switching, including overtaking or to achieve a minimal risk condition<br/>- Merge for high and low speed<br/>- Detect and respond to encroaching vehicles<br/>- Enhancing conspicuity (e.g., blinkers)<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicles turning at non-signalized junctions<br/>- Detect and respond to no passing zones
Navigate Intersection<br/>(Note: ODD may include signalized and non-signalized junctions) |<br/>- Navigate on/off ramps<br/>- Navigate roundabouts<br/>- Navigate signalized intersection<br/>- Detect and respond to traffic control devices<br/>- Navigate crosswalk<br/>- U-Turn<br/>- Car following through intersections, including stop and go, lead vehicle changing lanes, and responding to emergency braking<br/>- Navigate rail crossings<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicle running red light or stop sign<br/>- Vehicles turning - same direction<br/>- LTAP/OD at signalized junction and non-signalized junction<br/>- Navigate right turn at signalized and non-signalized junctions
Navigate Temporary or A-Typical Condition | <br/>- Detect and respond to work zone or temporary traffic patterns, including construction workers directing traffic<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant safety officials that are over-riding traffic control devices<br/>- Detect and respond to citizens directing traffic after an incident<br/>- N-point turn
OEDR Capabilities |
OEDR:<br/>Vehicles | <br/>- Detect and respond to encroaching, oncoming vehicles<br/>- Vehicle following<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant stopped vehicle, including in lane or on the side of the road<br/>- Detect and respond to lane changes, including unexpected cut-ins<br/>- Detect and respond to cut-outs, including unexpected reveals<br/>- Detect and respond to school buses<br/>- Detect and respond to emergency vehicles, including at intersections<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicle roadway entry<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant adjacent vehicles<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant vehicles when in forward and reverse
OEDR:<br/>Traffic Control Devices and Infrastructure | <br/>- Follow driving laws<br/>- Detect and respond to speed limit changes or advisories<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant access restrictions, including one-way streets, no-turn locations, bicycle lanes, transit lanes, and pedestrian ways (See MUTCD for more complete list))<br/>- Detect and respond to relevant traffic control devices, including signalized intersections, stop signs, yield signs, crosswalks, and lane markings (potentially including faded markings) (See MUTCD for more complete list)<br/>- Detect and respond to infrastructure elements, including curves, roadway edges, and guard rails (See AASHTO Green Book for more complete list)
OEDR:<br/>Vulnerable Road Users, Objects, Animals | <br/>- Detect and respond to relevant static obstacles in lane<br/>- Detect and respond to pedestrians, pedalcyclists, animals in lane or on side of road
Failure Modes | 
ODD Boundary | <br/>- Detect and respond to ODD boundary transition, including unanticipated weather or lighting conditions outside of vehicle's capability
Degraded Performance/ Health Monitoring, Including Achieving Minimal Risk Condition | <br/>- Detect degraded performance and respond with appropriate fail-safe/fail-operational mechanisms, including detect and respond to conditions involving vehicle, system, or component-level failures or faults (e.g., power failure, sensing failure, sensing obstruction, computing failure, fault handling or response) <br/>- Detect and respond to vehicle control loss (e.g., reduced road friction)<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicle road departure<br/>- Detect and respond to vehicle being involved in incident with another vehicle, pedestrian, or animal<br/>- Non-collision safety situations, including vehicle doors ajar, fuel level, engine overheating
Failure Mitigation Strategy | <br/>- Detect and respond to catastrophic event, for example flooding or debilitating cyber attack
